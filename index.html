        <p>Popin with a Buttery crime
            Greasy and oily as slime
            A crime wave to steal ingredients throughout
            A mouthwatering motion
            Across town in Poppintown, Popcorn Man and his Hitchmen are planning a precise plot
            Yet, the Police will have no choice in liking or not
            Within the Popcorn Clister Company, the Popcorn Man and his Hitchmen are attempting to steal all the
            production resources needed for the biggest crime wave of them all
            The Popcorn Man’s quest was to steal the Crown Jewels of Great Britain at the Popin Museum,
            but their plan was foiled by Batman and Robin
            They confronted Popcorn Man and his Hitchmen on the spot as they had figured out their plot
            A fight for justice broke out
            Robin hit one of the hitchmen with a *** of hot oil in the face
            Batman and Robin with all in between being Bam, Pow and Kaboom
            But something was going to happen soon
            Suddenly, Batman and Robin were caught by surprise and didn’t realize
            They were caught in a trap in all buttered up Popcorn
            How will Batman and Robin escape?
            Will Popcorn Man get away with his outrageous cape?
            Immediately, Batman pulls out of his utility belt an ingredient that causes everything to melt
            Batman and Robin managed to escape
            They must rush before it’s too late
            It’s a mission to put Popcorn Man in jail with a popping finish
            Popcorn Man is caught in the act, and Batman and Robin turn the tables on his hitchmen
            Batman throws hot butter on the floor, and the Hitchmen just slide right into large cage
            This causes Popcorn Man to respond in rage
            Popcorn man wanted to take venegeance, but Batman was too clever
            Batman pushed Popcorn Man into a Large Popcorn popping Machine and Kenneled out
            A crime wave solved
            It was the Cape Crusader who was involved.</p>
